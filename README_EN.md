#### Data × Marketing = Digital Marketing

Data science is a high affinity field with marketing.

Most recently, I have been engaged in the following activities related to digital marketing;

- Design, construction, and operation of data analysis infrastructure
  - Google BigQuery

  - ARM Treasure Data
- Data Utilization Advisor
  - Tableau Doctor(meanings of Tableau advice and coaching)
    - Tableau Desktop

## What do I want to do?

### I want to utilize safely and securely with Data with high social contribution

I am thinking of;

- Can I provide a safe and secure data platform?
- Can I get the right data in a sustainable and continuous way without depriving humans of disposable time?
- Can I work with and educate people about laws such as the Privacy Act and GDPR?
- Can I do something that will lead to business opportunities?

### Develop data-enabled human resources and Increase the market value of data personnel

I believe that data-literate human resources will change the future of business.  
I want to increase the value of data-enabled jobs such as data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers to the same level as in the United States and Europe.  

### Data Human Resources Community

I participate in events in the data human resources community to expand my knowledge and network.  
I am also a speaker when I have the opportunity.
