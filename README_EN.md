## What I'm interested in

### Data × ○○

#### Data × Marketing = Digital Marketing

Data science is a high affinity field with marketing.

Most recently, I have been engaged in the following activities related to digital marketing;

- Design, construction, and operation of data analysis infrastructure and CRM
  - Data Warehouse
    - Google BigQuery
    - Amazon Redshift
    - ARM Treasure Data

    - Tableau Prep Builder
    - Tableau Server
    - Tableau Cloud
  - Google
    - Looker Studio
    - BigQuery

#### Data × Engineering × Education = IT Training for non-Engineer

### Reading

- Theme
  - Business
  - Finance
  - History, Philosophy, and other liberal arts

## What do I want to do?

### I want to utilize safely and securely with Data with high social contribution

I am thinking of;

- Can I provide a safe and secure data platform?
- Can I get the right data in a sustainable and continuous way without depriving humans of disposable time?
- Can I work with and educate people about laws such as the Privacy Act and GDPR?
- Can I do something that will lead to business opportunities?

### Develop data-enabled human resources and Increase the market value of data personnel

I believe that data-literate human resources will change the future of business.  
I want to increase the value of data-enabled jobs such as data scientists, data engineers, and data stewart to the same level as in the United States and Europe.  

### Data Human Resources Community

I participate in events in the data human resources community to expand my knowledge and network.  
I am also a speaker when I have the opportunity.
